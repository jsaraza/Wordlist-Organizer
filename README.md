Word Lists

Created a class called `Wordlist` that stores words without any
duplicates. When it's done, you'll be able to add and remove words from it, and
also create an index of all its words in alphabetical order.

`Wordlist` Implemented the list as a **doubly-linked list** as its underlying representation.
Without using vectors, arrays, or other container data structures, except
for one case: the method `get_sorted_index()`, which returns a
`vector<string*>`.
